# Smart Study Planner

## Problem Statement
Many students struggle with managing their study schedules effectively, leading to missed deadlines, cramming, and inefficient learning.
Without a clear plan, it can be hard to balance multiple subjects and track progress. The Smart Study Planner aims to solve this by providing
an easy-to-use tool that organizes study schedules, sets achievable goals, and tracks completion rates.

## Project Objectives
* To help students organize their subjects and study sessions in a single program.
* To provide reminders and progress tracking to encourage consistent study habits.
* To allow easy updates to schedules as priorities change.
* To make study planning accessible to students of all technical skill levels.

## Planned Features
* Add, edit, and delete subjects from the study list.
* Set study goals for each subject.
* Track progress and completion percentage.
* Simple, menu-driven interface for ease of use.

## Planned Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs:
* Subject names
* Study time goals (daily or weekly)
* Progress updates from the user

### Outputs:
* Display of study schedule
* Progress percentage for each subject
* Notifications for completed or overdue goals

Methodology
The Study Planner was developed using Python as a command-line application.
Core features were implemented using functions that handle subject management, study time logging, and weekly progress resets. 
Study data is stored locally in a JSON file to allow persistence without requiring internet access.


Python was chosen because it is beginner-friendly and suitable for the student’s current level. 
JSON was selected for storage because it is lightweight and easy to read.

The program does not use a frontend–backend architecture. All user interaction and data processing occur within the same Python file.


Design decisions prioritized simplicity, privacy, and accessibility. No personal data is collected, and the interface uses clear text prompts to support ease of use. 
Ethical considerations such as user privacy and responsible data handling were guided by the Association for Computing Machinery Code of Ethics.
