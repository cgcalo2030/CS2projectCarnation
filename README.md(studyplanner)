# Smart Study Planner

## Problem Statement
Many students struggle with managing their study schedules effectively, leading to missed deadlines, cramming, and inefficient learning.
Without a clear plan, it can be hard to balance multiple subjects and track progress. The Smart Study Planner aims to solve this by providing
an easy-to-use tool that organizes study schedules, sets achievable goals, and tracks completion rates.

## Project Objectives
* To help students organize their subjects and study sessions in a single program.
* To provide reminders and progress tracking to encourage consistent study habits.
* To allow easy updates to schedules as priorities change.
* To make study planning accessible to students of all technical skill levels.

## Planned Features
* Add, edit, and delete subjects from the study list.
* Set study goals for each subject.
* Track progress and completion percentage.
* Simple, menu-driven interface for ease of use.

## Planned Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs:
* Subject names
* Study time goals (daily or weekly)
* Progress updates from the user

### Outputs:
* Display of study schedule
* Progress percentage for each subject
* Notifications for completed or overdue goals

Study Planner v2

Quarter 3 Project

Project Overview

The Study Planner is a Python-based command-line application designed to help students track their weekly study hours per subject. For Quarter 3, the project focuses on improving an existing system through code refactoring, documentation, and ethical evaluation rather than creating a completely new application.

This approach reflects real-world software development, where programs are continuously improved over time.

Features

Add, edit, and delete subjects

Set weekly study goals

Log study hours per subject

Automatic weekly reset of progress

Text-based progress bar

Local data storage using JSON



---

Methodology

The program is written in Python and uses functions to manage subjects, study time, and weekly resets. Study data is stored locally in a JSON file to allow the program to save progress even after closing.

Python was chosen because it is beginner-friendly and appropriate for the student’s level. JSON was used for storage because it is simple, lightweight, and easy to understand.

The application does not use a frontend–backend architecture. All logic and user interaction occur within the command line, which reduces complexity and avoids unnecessary dependencies.

Design decisions prioritized simplicity, readability, user privacy, and accessibility through clear text prompts.

Programming and Computing Ethics

All code in this repository was written by the student based on concepts learned in class. No proprietary or copyrighted code was copied.

User privacy is respected by not collecting personal information and by storing all data locally. Accessibility was considered by using a simple, text-based interface that is easy to navigate.

These practices align with the principles of the Association for Computing Machinery Code of Ethics, particularly regarding responsibility, honesty, and respect for users.
